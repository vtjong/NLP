# NLP
NLP library only using re, sys, and numpy modules with scripts to handle training, inference, and learning of part-of-speech tagger HMMs (Viterbi, Baum-Welsh); syntactic bottom-up CKY parsing; latent semantic frame identification

/cky contains code for syntactic bottom-up CKY parsing
/latent_struct contains latent semantic frame identification code (see: latent_struct/README.md)
/pos_tagger contains pos_tagger code

Note: /latent_struct is the most well-maintained, although all codes pushed are working codes.
